/**
 * runner-helpers/strategy-switch.ts — Shared strategy-switch application.
 *
 * Extracted from `iterate-pass.ts` in WS-6 CORRECTION 5 (2026-05-29). Both the
 * dispatcher-requested switch (`dispatcher-strategy-switch`) and the
 * loop-detector-triggered switch reinitialise the kernel for a new strategy
 * with IDENTICAL machinery:
 *
 *   1. fire `onStrategySwitched` hook
 *   2. build the handoff summary (9-line block)
 *   3. bump switchCount + push the new strategy onto triedStrategies
 *   4. re-seed `currentOptions` with the new strategy + `initialKernelState`
 *   5. inject synthetic "permanently unavailable" observation steps so the new
 *      strategy doesn't rediscover broken tools via wasted retries
 *   6. fold the handoff into `currentInput.priorContext`, drop failed tools
 *      from requiredTools, and rebuild `currentContext`
 *   7. reset the five per-loop counters (prevActionCount, requiredToolRedirects,
 *      consecutiveStalled, prevArtifactCount, failureRecoveryRedirects)
 *
 * Pre-CORRECTION-5 this block was duplicated near-verbatim at two call sites
 * (~80 LOC each). The ONLY differences were the `fromStrategy` fallback and the
 * failure-reason string; both are now explicit parameters.
 *
 * Invariants preserved:
 *   - transitionState() discipline — the synthetic-step append routes through
 *     `transitionState`, never a direct mutation.
 *   - No new state.status writer — `initialKernelState` seeds "thinking"; the
 *     terminate single-owner invariant is untouched (this helper never finalizes).
