// Run: bun test packages/reasoning/tests/assembly/thought-continuity.test.ts
//
// The model never sees its own reasoning on replay — by design.
//
// WIRE-CAPTURED 2026-07-10 (logging proxy in front of Ollama): a 6-iteration
// run whose EVERY assistant turn was `content: ""` — `project-results.ts`
// hardcoded it, and the `thought` EventLog kind was declared with zero writers
// (`from-kernel-state.ts` never emitted one). Meanwhile the persona instructs
// "think step by step". Tool results survived each turn; the model's plans,
// derivations, and self-corrections did not. For any task needing cumulative
// reasoning the model re-derives from scratch every turn.
//
// `from-kernel-state` was fixed to ALWAYS record a `thought` event for a
// non-empty assistant turn (recording what happened is not a rendering
// decision) — that half stands. Rendering it as replayed assistant content
// was gated behind `RA_THOUGHT_CONTINUITY=1` as an experimental mechanism;
// the 2026-09-15 ablation (wiki/Decisions/2026-09-15-experimental-flag-verdicts.md)
// found it INERT on the golden corpus and no accuracy lift on the one live
// tier measured — verdict DELETE. The flag and its rendering path are removed;
// every assistant turn renders `content: ""` unconditionally now.
